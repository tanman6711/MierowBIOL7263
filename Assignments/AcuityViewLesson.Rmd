## Install packages
`First thing we need to do is install the required packages and load them!!`
`install.packages("AcuityView", "fftwtools", "imager")`

## Load packages:

`library(AcuityView)`
`library(fftwtools)`
`library(imager)`

## Choose a test photo! 
`AcuityView requires an image that it will then render into the acuity you set it at, BUT this image needs to be a square where the dimensions are a power of two`

`img <- load.image('.../extdata/parrots.png')`

`dim(img)`

`img <- resize(img, 110, 40)`


## Calculate your animal's acuity

`MRA --> 1/CPD = `
`
## Run acuity view with your now resized image! 

`AcuityView(photo = NULL, distance = 2, realWidth = 2, eyeResolutionX = 8.14, eyeResolutionY = NULL, plot = T, output = "firstimage.jpg" )`

## Seminar Assignment
`1. Choose five animals from the databases given and calculate their acuity as MRA`
`2. Choose an image that is applicable to each of your animals own ecology (1 image for each animal) and resize that image to 512x512 dimensions`
`3. Create an output of your selected image at distance of 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m for your five animals`
`4. Knit and publish R markdown file onto your website as "seminar 1 assignment"`
